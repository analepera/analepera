# About Me
This respository is for you to know me.

I am Anabella, a sociologist trained to ask questions, but don't get me wrong, what I am looking for is to know more in order to gain precision to make better decisions. I have an analytical background in Social Sciences and currently, I am awaiting the defence of my doctoral thesis (PhD in Social Sciences). I have developed a strong background in sociology and health (due to my thesis on adherence to a health process and its accessibility conditions). I have a passion for using data to uncover relationships that are not intuitive and test those that are.

Over the past ten years I honed my ability to work with complex data and to develop strategies for coping with adversity and overcoming it when possible. I also gained experience in research methodologies, data management and statistical analysis (descriptive and predictive - such as logistic regressions), which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I like to explore new data analysis tools and techniques, so I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. That's why I'm doing a Data Analytics course at Coder House. But I also have experience of how useful it's to manage time, resources and projects, and I have experience teaching and managing teams, so I'm doing a project management course on Coursera. 

In my free time, I enjoy socialising with friends and family, the outdoors, cycling, volleyball, the gym and all that physical movement that compensates for my sitting down work in my hyper-focused moments.
